Official implementation of Holographic Invariant Storage for Mitigating LLM Drift.
As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale toward autonomous deployment, they face a critical reliability failure known as "Agent Drift." [5] Over extended interaction sequences, the accumulation of context noise statistically dilutes the model's adherence to initial safety constraints and objective functions. This report introduces Holographic Invariant Storage (HIS), a neuro-symbolic memory mechanism based on Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA). [1] Unlike probabilistic attention mechanisms, HIS encodes safety constraints as high-dimensional hypervectors (D=10,000) that remain mathematically orthogonal to accumulated context noise. We demonstrate through Monte Carlo simulation (n=1,000) that this mechanism recovers original safety objectives with a mean fidelity of 0.7078 (=0.0036) even under direct adversarial attack. This result aligns with the theoretical geometric bound of 12, proving that safety can be enforced as a deterministic structural constant.
